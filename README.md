# Design Patterns

Design patterns are standard solutions to common problems in software design. They help developers write code that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend. This repository contains simple examples of various design patterns implemented in Java, which are especially useful for software developers and mobile app developers.

#Why Design Patterns are Important
Design patterns are crucial for developers because they:

- Enhance Code Readability: Make it easier for others to understand the structure and flow of your code.
- Promote Reusability: Allow you to use tried and tested solutions, reducing the need to reinvent the wheel.
- Improve Maintainability: Make it simpler to update and manage code over time.
- Support Scalable Design: Help you build systems that can grow and evolve without significant rewrites.

For mobile app developers, design patterns ensure that your app is robust, scalable, and easier to manage, which is essential given the frequent updates and changing requirements in mobile app development.
