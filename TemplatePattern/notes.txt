//Template Pattern Definition
Template Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass
 but leaves some method to be defined in the subclass\

 //Template method ( declared as final)  Override is not allowed
 calls any of the methods listed above
 describe the algorithm without implementing the details

 //Abstract method ( declared as abstract)  Override is must
 no implementations , must be defined in the subclass

 //Concrete method ( declared as final)  Override is not allowed
 standard complete method useful to subclass
 usually utility methods

 //Hook method ( declared as normal method with implementations)  Override is optional
 contain  a default implementation
 may be overridden in some classes
 hook method are intended to be overridden,concrete methods are not
